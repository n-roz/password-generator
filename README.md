HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Password Generator

In this project, I created an application that will generate a random password based on criteria the user selects.

## Challenges

The biggest problem I faced was selecting the correct semantic elements. For the main section, I chose the section element over article following advice I received during instruction. I used the article element in the aside section just to try something different and because the result is the same.

Additionally, the .gitignore is completely unnecessary. I added it just because I wanted to, which I will admit is a silly reason. The file is empty but I wanted to practice with .gitignore.

## User Story

As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given I need a new, secure password, when I click the button to generate a password then I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria. When prompted for password criteria, then I select which criteria to include in the password. When prompted for the length of the password, then I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters. When asked for character types to include in the password, then I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. When I answer each prompt, then my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected. When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
