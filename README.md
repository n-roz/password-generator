HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Password Generator

In this project, I created an application that will generate a random password based on criteria the user selects.

## Challenges

The biggest problem I faced was selecting the correct semantic elements. For the main section, I chose the section element over article following advice I received during instruction. I used the article element in the aside section just to try something different and because the result is the same.

Additionally, the .gitignore is completely unnecessary. I added it just because I wanted to, which I will admit is a silly reason. The file is empty but I wanted to practice with .gitignore.

## User Story


As an employee with access to sensitive data, I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security.
